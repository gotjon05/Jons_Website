I’m an aspiring Data Scientist looking to make a positive impact on the world.

I’ve spent several years working in nonprofits, where I discovered how powerful technology can be in service of meaningful missions. Automating repetitive work has become a creative challenge I genuinely enjoy—first with scripts, and more recently through database APIs and workflow tools.

My time in my college Hacker Club shaped how I learn: I don’t feel I truly understand something until I can explain it clearly, document my process, and reflect on the mistakes and assumptions I made along the way.

Outside of tech, I’m an avid long-distance runner and occasional caver. I love being part of outdoor adventures and the perspective they bring to how I think and work.
