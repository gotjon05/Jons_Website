I'm an aspiring Data Scientist looking to make a positive impact on the world. 

Ive worked in non-profits for several of years where automating the boring stuff as been a fun challenge, using scripts and recently Database API.

Hacker Club in College had a big impact on my learning. I dont truly understand something unless I can explain what I have done in a write-up and the mistakes/assumptions i had along the way. 

I'm also an avid long distance runner who dabbles in caving. I really enjoy being part of outdoor adventures.
