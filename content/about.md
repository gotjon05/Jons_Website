I’m an aspiring Data Scientist looking to make a positive impact on the world.

I’ve spent several years working in nonprofits, where understanding work processes and improving them with technology has been a fun, creative challenge, with scripts and, more recently, through database APIs.

My time in my college Hacker Club shaped how I learn: I don’t feel I truly understand something until I can explain it clearly, document my process, and reflect on the mistakes and assumptions I made along the way. And “You never know if you’re right; you only know if you’re wrong.”

Outside of tech, I’m an avid long-distance runner and occasional caver. I love being part of outdoor adventures.
